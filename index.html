            <p>My days involve ghostwriting thought-leadership books, editing thrillers, coaching people through stuck projects, and building moonpaws (a pet astrology app that's equal parts whimsy and heart). I'm on my third or fourth career depending on how you count, and I live in upstate New York with my partner, our toddler, and our extremely dramatic dog.</p>

            <h2>Ghostwriting</h2>
            <p>Your life, your work, they all tell a story, even if you're not quite sure how yet. That's where I come in. I work mostly in the business and leadership space, using my coaching background to help you uncover what makes your message unique, then turning it into something people will actually want to read. Think of it as part excavation, part translation, part creative partnership.</p>

        <section id="editing" class="trade-section">
            <h2>Editing</h2>
            <p>I started my career editing thrillers at a big publishing house, and that's still where most of my projects land (though I'm an eclectic reader and love to work across genres). Developmental editing is about getting to the heart of what you're trying to say and making sure every piece serves that vision. I work with first-time novelists and seasoned authors alike. Several writers come back book after book, which tells you something about whether this process actually works.</p>

        <section id="moonpaws" class="trade-section">
            <h2>Building moonpaws</h2>
            <p>I co-run <a href="https://moonpaws.com/" target="_blank" class="inline-link">moonpaws</a>, a pet astrology app for dog parents who want to understand their pups through the stars. Here's the cool part: you don't need to know your dog's birth date or time to get a horoscope. We built the whole thing with heart, whimsy, and a genuine desire to make astrology accessible and fun. I write the newsletters, create the astrological guidance, and generally try to make the internet a more delightful place for people who love their dogs. <a href="https://moonpaws.com/" target="_blank" class="inline-link">Download the app</a> if you're curious.</p>

            <h2>Coaching</h2>
            <p>Got a project you keep putting off or can't quite get started? I'm an ACC-certified coach who works with people who are stuck, spinning, or just need someone to help them figure out what's actually blocking them. We work together in a focused four-week package to get you moving. No endless introspection, no rigid goal-setting frameworks. Just practical support for getting unstuck and making progress on what matters.</p>

            <h2>Creative writing</h2>
            <p>Writing begets writing, so I'm always cooking up something. Right now that includes a few creative projects and figuring out a new direction for my <a href="https://practicalmagic.substack.com" target="_blank" class="inline-link">Substack</a> on astrology and being human. The archive is there if you want to poke around while I figure out what comes next.</p>
